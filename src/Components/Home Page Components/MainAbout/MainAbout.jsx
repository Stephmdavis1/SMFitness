          <p className="text-box">I'm an international health, fitness and wellness coach who specializes in a higher fat approach to nutrition. Through both mind and body, my ultimate goal is to help men and women reach their goals and enhance their life.</p>

            Exercise has always been a big part of my life. The older I got the
            more I loved it and the more physically active I was the better I
            felt. I knew that whatever my career was, fitness would have to be
            some part of it.Â So it was no surprise when I graduated from the University of West
            Florida with a degree in Exercise Science. I have been personal
            training ever since and have loved it.

            As a Professional Fitness Trainer, my passion is to guide people
            towards a healthier lifestyle. Everybody is unique, with their own
            strengths and limitations. My method is to build plans based
            on your heath, schedule and more importantly, your fitness goals. I
            aim to transform your body and influence you to make more mindful
            decision when it comes to your health.
