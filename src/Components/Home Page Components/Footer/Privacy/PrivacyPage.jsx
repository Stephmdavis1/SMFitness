            interactions with the Sites, your account settings, the products and
            features you use, your location, and the applicable law. We collect
            non-personally identifiable information about you in a number of
            ways, including tracking your activities through your IP address,
            location, browser type, computer settings or most-recently visited
            URL. We do not collect any personally identifiable information about
            you unless you voluntarily submit such information to us, by, for
            example, filling out a survey or a registration form. The types of
            information that may be requested in such a submission include your

          </p>
          <p>
            On some of our pages, you can order products, make requests, and
            register to receive materials. While you ship, we track the products
            you have viewed. The types of personal information collected at
            these pages are:

          <p>
            Any financial information (like credit card number and expiration
            date) we collect is used for billing purposes and to fill your
            orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we’ll use this
            information to contact you.
          </p>
          <p>
            On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For
            example, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the
            recipient, you will need to submit the recipient’s address. In this
            circumstance, the additional types of personal information collected
            are your recipient’s:

          <p>How we collect your information</p>
          <p>
            You directly provide us with most of the information we collect. We
            collect and process information when you:

            Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your personal
            information available for viewing by third parties online – for
            example on message boards, web logs, through email, or in chat areas
            – that information can be seen, collected and used by others besides

          <p className="privacy-text-title">Processing Orders</p>
          <p>
            When we process your orders, we send your data to our payment
            processors. We accept payments through Stripe. When processing
            payments, some of your data will be passed to Stripe, including
            information required to process or support the payment, such as the
            purchase total and billing information. We will generally not store
            or collect your payment card details. That information is provided
            directly to our third-party payment processors whose use of your
            personal information is governed by their own privacy policies.
            These payment processors adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as
            managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint
            effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard, American Express and
            Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of
            payment information.
